<div class="para">Assume Tychonoff's theorem is true. We will prove the following equivalent formulation of the axiom of choice:</div>

<div class="para">Given a collection <span class="process-math">\(\{X_i\}_{i\in I}\)</span> of nonempty sets, let <span class="process-math">\(Y_i=X_i\sqcup \{P_i\}\)</span> the result of adding one additional point, <span class="process-math">\(P_i\text{,}\)</span> to each <span class="process-math">\(X_i\text{.}\)</span> Why do we do this? We can with assurance that the product <span class="process-math">\(Y=\prod_{i\in I}Y_i\)</span> is nonempty since the <span class="process-math">\((P_i)_{i\in I}\)</span> is an element of <span class="process-math">\(Y\text{.}\)</span> We will use Tychonoff's theorem to show that <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is a nonempty subset of <span class="process-math">\(Y\text{.}\)</span> To do so, we need to give the sets <span class="process-math">\(Y_i\)</span> a <em class="emphasis">compact</em> topological structure: this is accomplished by declaring the topology on <span class="process-math">\(Y_i\)</span> to be <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{T}_i=\{\emptyset, X_i, \{P_i\}, Y_i\}\text{.}\)</span> (Check that this is a topology.) This clearly makes <span class="process-math">\(Y_i\)</span> compact, since <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{T}_i\)</span> only contains four open sets. Note also that <span class="process-math">\(X_i=Y_i-\{P_i\}\)</span> is closed with respect to this topology.</div>

<div class="para">Since each <span class="process-math">\(Y_i\)</span> is compact, by Tychonoff's theorem so is <span class="process-math">\(Y=\prod_{i\in I}Y_i\text{.}\)</span> For each <span class="process-math">\(i\in I\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(\pi_i\colon Y\rightarrow Y_i\)</span> be the <span class="process-math">\(i\)</span>th projection map and define</div>

<div class="para">Since <span class="process-math">\(X_i=Y_i-\{P_i\}\)</span> is closed in <span class="process-math">\(Y_i\text{,}\)</span> and since <span class="process-math">\(\pi_i\)</span> is continuous, the set <span class="process-math">\(C_i\)</span> is closed for each <span class="process-math">\(i\in I\text{.}\)</span> Furthermore given any finite set <span class="process-math">\(\{i_1,i_2,\dots,i_n\}\subseteq I\text{,}\)</span> the set <span class="process-math">\(\bigcap_{k=1}^nC_{i_k}\)</span> is nonempty: indeed, by the <em class="emphasis">finite axiom of choice</em> principle (which is implied by ZF set theory) there exists a tuple <span class="process-math">\((x_{i_1}, x_{i_2}, \dots, x_{i_n})\in \prod_{k=1}^nX_{i_k}\text{,}\)</span> and thus the element <span class="process-math">\(y=(y_i)_{i\in I}\)</span> defined as</div>

<div class="para">is an element of <span class="process-math">\(\bigcap_{k=1}^n C_{i_k}\text{.}\)</span> Now since <span class="process-math">\(Y\)</span> is compact, we have <span class="process-math">\(\bigcap_{i\in I}C_i\ne\emptyset\text{,}\)</span> using the finite intersection characterization of compactness.
