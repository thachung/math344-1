<div class="para">It is clear that (2) implies (1): for any <span class="process-math">\(x\in X\text{,}\)</span> taking <span class="process-math">\(U=X\text{,}\)</span> we get an open neighborhood <span class="process-math">\(V\ni x\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(\overline{V}\)</span> is compact. Thus <span class="process-math">\(K\)</span> is a compact neighborhood of <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">We now show (1) implies (2). Munkres' proof elegantly uses the one-point compactification of <span class="process-math">\(X\text{.}\)</span> Solely by way of contrast I proceed more directly. Fix <span class="process-math">\(x\in X\)</span> and open neighborhood <span class="process-math">\(U\ni x\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is locally compact, we have <span class="process-math">\(x\in U'\subseteq K\)</span> for some open set <span class="process-math">\(U'\)</span> and compact set <span class="process-math">\(K\text{.}\)</span> Taking <span class="process-math">\(U'\cap U\)</span> we may assume further that <span class="process-math">\(U'\subseteq U\text{.}\)</span> The set <span class="process-math">\(C=K-U\)</span> is a closed subset of the compact set <span class="process-math">\(K\text{,}\)</span> hence compact. Since <span class="process-math">\(X\)</span> is Hausdorff, we can find disjoint open sets <span class="process-math">\(V', W'\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(C\text{,}\)</span> respectively. (See <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_compact_Haus_closed.html" title="Theorem 1.15.7: Compact implies closed in Hausdorff spaces">Theorem 1.15.7</a>.) Let <span class="process-math">\(V=V'\cap U\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\overline{V}\subseteq K\)</span> is a closed subset of a compact set, it is compact. Furthermore, since <span class="process-math">\(\overline{V}\)</span> is disjoint from <span class="process-math">\(C=K-U\text{,}\)</span> we must have <span class="process-math">\(V\subseteq\overline{V}\subseteq U\text{.}\)</span>
