<div class="para">We now give a proof of Tychonoff's theorem using nets. The first such proof was given by UC Berkeley mathematician John L. Kelley in his 1950 paper <em class="emphasis">Convergence in topology</em>. Our proof draws from a couple of slight improvements to Kelley's original argument, both proffered by additional UC Berkeley mathematicians. (Go Bears!) Paul Chernoff's <a class="external" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2324485" target="_blank">A simple proof of Tychonoff's theorem via nets</a><a href="" class="fn-knowl original" data-knowl="./knowl/fn-1-hidden.html" title="Footnote 1.25.1"><sup> 1 </sup></a> removed the need for universal nets in Kelley's argument; Charles Pugh is credited for <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/lemma_product_nets.html" title="Lemma 1.25.5: Nets in products">Lemma 1.25.5</a>, which removes the argument's reliance on subnets. All of these various proofs invoke <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/th_Zorns_lemma.html" title="Theorem 1.25.4: Zorn's lemma">Zorn's lemma</a>, which as it turns out is equivalent to the axiom of choice. You may be asking: Is there a proof of the Tychonoff theorem that does not rely on the axiom of choice? Amazingly, the answer is no! In fact, Kelley himself proved that Tychonoff's theorem is equivalent to the axiom of choice in another paper from 1950: <em class="emphasis">The Tychonoff product theorem implies the axiom of choice</em>. His argument is simply too elegant not to include here. (Note: Kelley's original argument had a minor flaw that is corrected in the proof below. I encourage you to look at the original article and see if you can find the invalid step.)</div>
