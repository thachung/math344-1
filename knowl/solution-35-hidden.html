Take a closed set <span class="process-math">\(C\subseteq [0,1]\text{.}\)</span> To show its image <span class="process-math">\(g(C)\)</span> is closed in <span class="process-math">\(\R/Z\text{,}\)</span> we need only show, using the fact that <span class="process-math">\(q\)</span> is a quotient map, that <span class="process-math">\(q^{-1}(g(C))\)</span> is closed in <span class="process-math">\(\R/\Z\text{.}\)</span> We have <span class="process-math">\(q^{-1}(g(C))=C+\Z=\{c+n\colon c\in C, n\in \Z\}\text{.}\)</span> This set is the result of starting with our original closed set <span class="process-math">\(C\subseteq [0,1]\)</span> and taking the union of translated copies of the form <span class="process-math">\(C+n\subseteq [n,n+1]\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(n\in \Z\text{.}\)</span> It is easy to see that each translate <span class="process-math">\(C+n\)</span> is closed; since furthermore <span class="process-math">\(C+n\subseteq [n,n+1]\text{,}\)</span> it follows that the union is also closed. I'll leave the details to you.</div></li>

<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(q\colon\R\rightarrow \R/\Z\)</span> be the quotient map. Consider the diagram <div class="image-box" style="width: 25%; margin-left: 37.5%; margin-right: 37.5%;"><img src="generated/latex-image/eg_quotient_homeo.svg" role="img" class="contained"></div> where <span class="process-math">\(g(t)=(\cos 2\pi t, \sin 2\pi t)\text{.}\)</span> It is easy to see that <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is continuous, surjective, and satisfies <span class="process-math">\(g(t_1)=g(t_2)\iff t_1=t_2+n\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(n\in \Z\text{.}\)</span> It follows from <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/cor_quotientspace_props.html" title="Corollary 1.11.7: Mapping property of quotients">Corollary 1.11.7</a> that the map <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is bijective and continuous. Furthermore, by the same result, we can show <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is a homeomorphism as long as we can show <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is a quotient map. I'll show that in fact <span class="process-math">\(g\colon \R\rightarrow S^1\)</span> is open, and hence a projection map.</div>
<div class="para">To this end let <span class="process-math">\(U\subseteq \R\)</span> be any open set, and let <span class="process-math">\(P\in f(U)\text{,}\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(P=g(t)\)</span> for some <span class="process-math">\(t\in U\text{.}\)</span> We will find an open interval <span class="process-math">\(I\)</span> satisfying <span class="process-math">\(t\in I\subseteq U\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f(I)\)</span> is open. Since <span class="process-math">\(P\in f(I)\subseteq f(U)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(P\in f(U)\)</span> was arbitrary, this will show that <span class="process-math">\(f(U)\)</span> is open.</div>
<div class="para">Let <span class="process-math">\(g(t)=P=(x,y)\text{.}\)</span> Since we cannot have <span class="process-math">\(x=y=0\text{,}\)</span> we have four cases: <span class="process-math">\(y&gt;0\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(y&lt; 0\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x&gt; 0\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(x&lt; 0\text{.}\)</span> I will treat the first case; my argument is easily adapted to the other cases. Assume <span class="process-math">\(y&gt; 0\text{.}\)</span> Since the set <span class="process-math">\(V=S^1\cap \left(\R\times (0,\infty)\right)\)</span> is open in <span class="process-math">\(S^1\text{,}\)</span> we can find an open interval <span class="process-math">\(I=(a,b)\ni t\)</span> contained in <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> such <span class="process-math">\(g(I)\subseteq V \text{:}\)</span> i.e., all points in <span class="process-math">\(g(I)\)</span> lie in the the upper half plane. Elementary trigonometric properties tell us that the function <span class="process-math">\(h(t)=\cos 2\pi t\)</span> is strictly decreasing on <span class="process-math">\(I\text{,}\)</span> and hence that <span class="process-math">\(h(I)\)</span> is the open interval <span class="process-math">\((\cos 2\pi b, \cos 2\pi a)=(c,d)\text{.}\)</span> It is now easy to see that <span class="process-math">\(g(I)=\{(x,y)\colon x\in (c,d), y=+\sqrt{1-x^2}\}=S^1\cap \left((c,d)\times \R\right)\text{,}\)</span> which is open.</div>
