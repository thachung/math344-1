<div class="para">Propositions like “All humans are mortal” and “Every positive real number has a square-root” are modeled in logic in the form “For all <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(P(x)\)</span>” and “For all <span class="process-math">\(r\text{,}\)</span> there exists an <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(Q(r,s)\)</span>”, where <span class="process-math">\(P(x)\)</span> stands for the phrase “<span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is mortal” and <span class="process-math">\(Q(r,s)\)</span> stands for the phrase “<span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> is a square-root of <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span>”. Observe that <span class="process-math">\(P(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q(r,s)\)</span> on their own are not propositions; there is no truth value to “<span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> is mortal” or “<span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> is a square-root of <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span>”. Instead, we think of <span class="process-math">\(P(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q(r,s)\)</span> as <em class="emphasis">functions</em> which return propositions when evaluated at a specific choice for <span class="process-math">\(x\text{,}\)</span> or for <span class="process-math">\(r\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(s\text{.}\)</span> For example, evaluating <span class="process-math">\(P(x)\)</span> at <span class="process-math">\(x=\text{Aaron Greicius}\)</span> yields the proposition “Aaron Greicius is mortal”, which happens to be true at the time of writing. Similarly evaluating <span class="process-math">\(Q(r,s)\)</span> at  <span class="process-math">\(r=2, s=11\)</span> yields the proposition “<span class="process-math">\(11\)</span> is a square-root of 2”, which happens to be false. In logic  <span class="process-math">\(P(x)\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(Q(r,s)\)</span> are called <em class="emphasis">propositional functions</em> (also called  <em class="emphasis">predicates</em>): functions whose outputs are propositions.</div>
