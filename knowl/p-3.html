<div class="para">We use curly braces to describe the contents of a set. For example, <span class="process-math">\(A=\{1,2,3\}\)</span> is the set containing the first three positive integers, and <span class="process-math">\(B=\{1,2,3,\dots\}\)</span> is the set of all positive integers. The defining property of sets is that they are completely determined by their members, and nothing more. In particular, when describing sets as above, it does not matter in what order the elements are listed, nor if they are repeated: e.g., <span class="process-math">\(\{1,2,3\}\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\{2,1,3\}\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(\{2,1,1,3,2\}\)</span> are three descriptions of the same set. This somewhat slippery notion is made perfectly clear by specifying exactly what it means for two sets to be equal, as we do below.</div>
