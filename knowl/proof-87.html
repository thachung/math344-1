<div class="para">First observe that <span class="process-math">\(\widetilde{g}\)</span> is a well-defined function: if <span class="process-math">\(s\in S\cap S'\text{,}\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\((S,g),(S',g')\in \mathcal{F}\text{,}\)</span> then since <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is a chain either <span class="process-math">\((S,g)\leq (S',g')\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\((S',g')\leq (S,g)\text{;}\)</span> assuming without loss of generality that <span class="process-math">\((S,g)\leq (S',g')\)</span> we have <span class="process-math">\(g'\vert_S=g\)</span> by definition, and hence that <span class="process-math">\(g(s)=g'(s)\text{.}\)</span> Next we must show that <span class="process-math">\(\widetilde{g}\text{,}\)</span> understood as an element of <span class="process-math">\(\prod_{t\in \widetilde{S}}X_t\text{,}\)</span> is a limit point of the net <span class="process-math">\((f_i\vert_{\widetilde{S}})_{i\in I}\text{.}\)</span> Using the usual product topology basis, it suffices to show that given any finite set <span class="process-math">\(F\subseteq \widetilde{S}\)</span> and open set of the form <span class="process-math">\(U=\prod_{t\in F}U_t\times \prod_{t\in \widetilde{S}-F}X_t\text{,}\)</span> and given any <span class="process-math">\(i\in I\text{,}\)</span> there is an <span class="process-math">\(i'\geq i\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f_i\vert_{\widetilde{S}}\in U\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is finite, we have <span class="process-math">\(F\subseteq \bigcup_{k=1}^nS_k\)</span> for some sets <span class="process-math">\(S_k\)</span> satisfying <span class="process-math">\((S_k, g_k)\in \mathcal{C}\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is a chain, there is an index <span class="process-math">\(k_0\in \{k_1,k_2,\dots, k_n\}\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(S_{k_0}\supseteq S_k\)</span> for all  <span class="process-math">\(1\leq k\leq n\text{.}\)</span> Thus we may assume there is an element <span class="process-math">\((S, g)\in \mathcal{F}\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(F\subseteq S\text{.}\)</span> By definition <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> is a limit point of the net <span class="process-math">\((f_i\vert_S)_{i\in I}\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(\widetilde{g}\vert_S=g\text{,}\)</span> it follows that <span class="process-math">\(g\in \prod_{t\in F}X_t\times \prod_{t\in S-F}X_t\text{.}\)</span> Thus there is an <span class="process-math">\(i'\geq i\)</span> such that <span class="process-math">\(f_{i'}\vert_S\in \prod_{t\in F}X_t\times \prod_{t\in S-F}X_t\text{.}\)</span> It follows easily that <span class="process-math">\(f_{i'}\vert_{\widetilde{S}}\in \prod_{t\in F}X_t\times \prod_{t\in \widetilde{S}-F}X_t\text{.}\)</span> This proves <span class="process-math">\(\widetilde{g}\)</span> is a limit point of <span class="process-math">\((f_i\vert_\widetilde{S})_{i\in I}\text{,}\)</span> and hence that <span class="process-math">\((\widetilde{S}, \widetilde{g})\in \mathcal{F}\text{.}\)</span> It is clear from the definition of <span class="process-math">\((\widetilde{S},\widetilde{g})\text{,}\)</span> that it is an upper bound of <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal{C}\text{.}\)</span>
