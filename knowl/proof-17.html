<div class="para">Statements (1)-(2): properties of open (resp. closed) sets imply that <span class="process-math">\(A^\circ\)</span> is open and <span class="process-math">\(\overline{A}\)</span> is closed. Furthermore, by definition of <span class="process-math">\(A^\circ\)</span> (resp. <span class="process-math">\(\overline{A}\)</span>) along with simple properties of union/intersection it follows that if <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is open and <span class="process-math">\(U\subseteq A\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(U\subseteq A^\circ\text{;}\)</span> and if <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is closed containing <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> then <span class="process-math">\(\overline{A}\subseteq C\text{.}\)</span>
</div> <div class="para">The first equivalence in (3) follows from the definition of <span class="process-math">\(A^\circ\)</span> as a union. The second equivalence follows from the fact that any <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> is covered by basis elements.</div> <div class="para">We prove (4) as a chain of equivalences.
