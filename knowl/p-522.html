<div class="para">This is now the result of the fact that being homeomorphic is an equivalence relation. In more detail, from (1) we know that all finite open intervals are homeomorphic; this in conjunction with (2) shows that all finite open intervals are homemorphic to <span class="process-math">\(\R\text{.}\)</span> From (3) we conclude that all half-finite intervals are homeomorphic to <span class="process-math">\(\R\text{.}\)</span> Since any open interval is either finite, half-finite, or equal to <span class="process-math">\(\R\text{,}\)</span> we conclude that all open intervals are homeomorphic.</div>
