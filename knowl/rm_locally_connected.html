</h3> <div class="para">Somewhat curiously, a space being connected does not necessarily imply that the space is locally connected. For example, the <a href="" class="xref" data-knowl="./knowl/top_eg_topologist_sine_curve.html" title="Topological specimen 14: Topologist's sine curve">topologist's sine curve</a> <span class="process-math">\(\overline{S}\)</span> is connected, but not locally connected. For example, take the point <span class="process-math">\(P=(0,0)\in \overline{S}\)</span> and the open set <span class="process-math">\(U=[0,1]\times (-1/2,1/2)\cap \overline{S}\text{.}\)</span>  Graphically, it is easy to see that <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> has a connected component partition consisting of <span class="process-math">\(\{0\}\times (-1/2,1/2)\)</span> and infinitely many connected segments of the graph of <span class="process-math">\(f(x)=\sin (1/x)\)</span> (one segment for each interval of the form <span class="process-math">\((1/(\pi/6+\pi n), 1/(-\pi/6+\pi n)\)</span> that lies in <span class="process-math">\([0,1]\)</span>). Any open connected set containing <span class="process-math">\((0,0)\)</span> would have to lie in the connected component <span class="process-math">\(\{0\}\times (-1/2,1/2)\text{;}\)</span> but this is impossible since <span class="process-math">\(\{0\}\times (-1/2, 1/2)\)</span> does not contain any open sets!</div></article><span class="incontext"><a href="s_connected_components.html#rm_locally_connected" class="internal">in-context</a></span>
