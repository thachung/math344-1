  <title>Continuous functions</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>
      In calculus you learn that a function <m>f\colon \R\rightarrow \R</m> is defined to be continuous if for all <m>\epsilon &gt; 0</m> there is a <m>\delta &gt; 0</m> such that for all <m>x,x'\in \R</m> we have the implication
      <me>
        \abs{x-x'}&lt; \delta \implies \abs{f(x)-f(x')}&lt; \epsilon
      </me>.
      Now that we have some experience generalizing analysis concepts to topological ones, let's see how best this translates to arbitrary topologies.

  <title>Continuous function</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>(X,\mathcal{T}), (Y,\mathcal{T}')</m> be topological spaces. A function <m>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> is <term>continuous</term> if for all open sets <m>U\subseteq Y</m>, the set <m>f^{-1}(U)</m> is open in <m>X</m>. Using logical shorthand:

      Continuity is defined in terms of <xref ref="d_preimage_of_set" text="custom">preimages of sets</xref> under a function <m>f</m>. Thankfully, the preimage operation behaves very well with respect to our various set operations. In particular, we have the following identities, which you may make use of without further ado:
      <mdn>
        <mrow>f^{-1}\left(\bigcup_{i\in I}A_i\right) \amp = \bigcup_{i\in I}f^{-1}(A_i)</mrow>
        <mrow>f^{-1}\left(\bigcap_{i\in I}A_i\right) \amp = \bigcap_{i\in I}f^{-1}(A_i)</mrow>
        <mrow> f^{-1}(A^c) \amp =(f^{-1}(A))^c</mrow>

          Given a topological space <m>(X,\mathcal{T})</m>, the identity function

          Let <m>X, Y</m> be topological spaces. For any fixed <m>y_0\in Y</m> the constant function <m>f</m>, defined as <m>f(x)=y_0</m> for all <m>x\in X</m> is continuous.

          If <m>Y</m> is equipped with the trivial topology, then any map <m>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> from a topological space to <m>Y</m> is continous.

      </li>

  <solution>
    <p>
      These are all pretty elementary. I'll prove (3). Let <m>Y\subseteq X</m> be a subspace and let <m>i\colon Y\hookrightarrow X</m>  continuous. Given any open set <m>U\subseteq X</m>, we have <m>i^{-1}(U)=U\cap Y</m> which by definition is open in the subspace topology. Thus <m>i</m> is continuous.
    </p>
  </solution>
</example>
<example>
  <title>Non-continuous inclusion</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Show that the identity map <m>\id_\R\colon \R\hookrightarrow \R_l</m> is not continuous. Here the topology of the domain is the standard one, and the topology on the codomain is the lower limit topology.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      For any <m>U\subseteq \R</m> we have <m>\id_\R^{-1}(U)=U</m>. If we choose <m>U</m> to be any open set of <m>\R_l</m> that is not open in the standard topology, it follows that <m>\id_{\R}^{-1}(U)</m> is not open in <m>\R</m> and hence that <m>\id_\R</m> is not continuous. We may take <m>U=[0,1)</m> for example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: let <m>\mathcal{T}_1, \mathcal{T}_2</m> be two topologies on the set <m>X</m>, and for <m>1\leq i\leq 2</m> let <m>X_i</m> denote the space with underlying set <m>X</m> and topology <m>\mathcal{T}_i</m>. The same argument above can be used to show that <m>\id_X\colon X_1\rightarrow X_2</m> is continuous if and only if <m>\mathcal{T}_2\subseteq \mathcal{T}_1</m>.

  <title>Products and projections</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>\{X_i, \mathcal{T}_i\}_{i\in I}</m> be a collection of topological spaces, and let <m>X=\prod_{i\in I}X_i</m>. For each <m>j\in I</m> define the projection function <m>
      \pi_j\colon X\rightarrow X_j</m> as <m>\pi_j((x_i)_{i\in I})=x_i</m>. In other words, the <m>j</m>-th projection map returns the <m>j</m>-th coordinate of an element of <m>X</m>.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Prove: if <m>X</m> is given the product topology, then <m>\pi_j</m> is continuous for all <m>j\in J</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Prove: given a topology <m>\mathcal{T}</m> on <m>X</m>, we have <m>\pi_j</m> continuous for all <m>j\in J</m> if and only if <m>\mathcal{T}</m> contains the product topology.

          Thus, in particular, the product topology is the coarsest topology on <m>X</m> making each projection map continuous.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <p>
      It is enough to prove (2), since it clearly implies (1). The maps <m>\pi_j</m> are continuous in a topology <m>\mathcal{T}</m> if and only if for all <m>j\in I</m> and open <m>U_j\subseteq X_j</m> the preimage <m>\pi_j^{-1}(U_j)=U_j\times \prod_{i\ne j}X_i</m> is open in <m>\mathcal{T}</m>. Next it clear that <m>U_j\times \prod_{i\ne j}X_i</m> is open in <m>\mathcal{T}</m> for all <m>j\in J</m> if and only if
      <me>
      \cap_{k=1}^nU_{j_k}\times \prod_{i\ne j_k}X_i=\prod_{k=1}^n U_{j_k}\times \prod_{i\ne j_k}X_i
      </me> is open for any finite set <m>\{j_1, j_2,\dots, j_n\}\subseteq I</m>. Since these sets form a basis for the product topology, we conclude that the projections are all continuous if and only if <m>\mathcal{T}</m> is finer than the product topology.
    </p>

<theorem xml:id="th_continuity_basis">
  <statement>
      <p>
        Let <m>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> be a function between the topological spaces <m>X, Y</m>, and let <m>\mathcal{B}</m> be a basis for <m>Y</m>. The following statements are equivalent.
      </p>

        <m>f</m> is continuous.

    </li>
  </ol>
  </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      It is clear that (1) implies (2). Assume (2) is true. Given open <m>U\subseteq Y</m>, we can write <m>U=\bigcup_{i\in I}B_i</m> with <m>B_i\in \mathcal{B}</m>. It follows that
      <me>
        f^{-1}(U)=\bigcup_{i\in I}f^{-1}(B_i)
      </me>
      is open, since by assumption each <m>f^{-1}(B_i)</m> is open.

  <title>Continuity equivalences</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> be a function between the topological spaces <m>X, Y</m>. The following statements are equivalent.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          <m>f</m> is continuous.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For all <m>A\subseteq X</m>, we have <m>f(\overline{A})\subseteq \overline{f(A)}</m>.
        </p>

      <li>
        <p>
          For all closed sets <m>C\subseteq Y</m>, the preimage <m>f^{-1}(C)</m> is closed in <m>X</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          For all <m>x\in X</m> and open neighborhood <m>V\ni y=f(x)</m>, there is an open neighborhood <m>U\ni x</m> such that <m>f(U)\subseteq V</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </statement>
  <proof>
  <p>
    <m>(1)\implies (2)</m>. Take <m>y\in f(\overline{A})</m>. We have <m>y=f(x)</m> for some <m>x\in \overline{A}</m>. If <m>V</m> is any open neighborhood of <m>y</m>, then since <m>f</m> is continuous <m>U=f^{-1}(V)</m> is an open neighborhood of <m>x</m>. Since <m>x\in\overline{A}</m>, there exists <m>x'\in A\cap U</m>. It follows that <m>y'=f(x')\in V\cap f(A)</m>, showing this intersection is nonempt. We concdlue that <m>y\in \overline{f(A)}</m>, as desited.
  </p>
  <p>
    <m>(2)\implies (3)</m>. Assume (2) holds of <m>f</m>. Given closed <m>C\subseteq Y</m> let <m>A=f^{-1}(C)</m>. To show <m>A</m> is closed, we will show that <m>\overline{A}\subseteq A</m>. Since <m>A=f^{-1}(C)</m>, this is equivalent to showing <m>f(\overline{A})\subseteq C</m>; but this follows from (2) since <m>f(\overline{A})\subseteq \overline{f(A)}\subseteq C</m>, where the last inclusion in this chain follows from the fact that <m>C</m> is closed and contains <m>f(A)</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <m>(3)\implies (4)</m>. Let <m>x\in X</m>, and let <m>V</m> be an open neighborhood of <m>y=f(x)</m>. The set <m>C=Y-V</m> is closed, whence <m>f^{-1}(C)=X-f^{-1}(V)</m> is closed. It follows that <m>U=f^{-1}(V)</m> is an open set containing <m>x</m>, and we have <m>f(U)=f(f^{-1}(V))\subseteq V</m>.
  </p>
  <p>
    <m>(4)\implies (1)</m>. We assume (4). Let <m>V\subseteq Y</m> be an open set. For any <m>x\in f^{-1}(V)</m>, there is by (4) (taking open set <m>V\ni y=f(x)</m>) an open set <m>U_x\ni x</m> such that <m>f(U_x)\subseteq V</m>. It follows that <m>U_x\subseteq f^{-1}(V)</m>. Thus for any <m>x\in f^{-1}(V)</m> there is an open <m>U_x\ni x</m> such that <m>U_x\subseteq V</m>. It follows that <m>f^{-1}(V)</m> is open, as desired.

    </p>
    <p>
      Statement (4) follows from equivalent condition (4) from <xref ref="th_continuous_equivalence"/>. Indeed, take any <m>x\in X</m> and open set <m>V\ni y=f(x)</m>. Since <m>x\in U_i</m> for some <m>i\in I</m>, and since <m>f_i\colon U_i\rightarrow Y</m> is continuous, there is an open <m>U\ni x</m> with <m>U\subseteq U_i</m>, such that <m>f(U)\subseteq V</m>. Since <m>U</m> is open in <m>U_i</m> and <m>U_i</m> is open in <m>X</m>, we conclude <m>U</m> is open in <m>X</m>, as desired.

    <p>
      To prove statement (5) we show that <m>h^{-1}(A)</m> is closed for any closed set <m>A\subseteq Y</m>. Since <m>h(x)\in A</m> if and only if <m>x\in C</m> and <m>f(x)\in A</m> or <m>x\in D</m> and <m>g(x)\in A</m>, we have <m>h^{-1}(A)=f^{-1}(A)\cup g^{-1}(A)</m>. Since <m>f</m> and <m>g</m> are closed we have <m>f^{-1}(A)</m> closed in <m>C</m> and <m>g^{-1}(A)</m>
      closed in <m>D</m>. Since <m>C</m> and <m>D</m> are closed, transitivity of closedness implies <m>f^{-1}(A)</m> and <m>g^{-1}(A)</m> are closed in <m>X</m>. We conclude <m>h^{-1}(A)=f^{-1}(A)\cup g^{-1}(A)</m> is closed, as desired.
