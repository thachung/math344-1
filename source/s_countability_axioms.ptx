        <p>
            Assume <m>X</m> is countable. A nonempty open set of <m>X</m> is of the form <m>U=X-\{x_1,x_2,\dots, x_n\}</m> for some <m>n</m>. It follows that the nonempty open sets of <m>X</m> are in bijection with the set of all finite subsets of <m>X</m>. By <xref ref="rm_countable"/>, this collection is countable. Thus <m>X</m> has countably many open sets. Thus for any <m>x\in X</m> the set of all open sets containing <m>x</m> is countable.

            Assume <m>X</m> is first countable. Take any <m>x\in X</m> and let <m>\{V_n\}</m> be a countable local basis at <m>x</m>. By definition we have <m>V_n^c</m> finite for each <m>n</m>, in which case <m>\{x\}\cup \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty V_n^c</m> is countable, being a countable union of countable sets. I claim <m>X=\{x\}\cup \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty V_n^c</m>, proving <m>X</m> is countable. Indeed, take any <m>y\ne x</m>. The set <m>U=X-\{y\}</m> is an open set containing <m>x</m>. Thus we have <m>V_n\subseteq X-\{y\}</m> for some <m>n</m>, in which case <m>\{y\}\subseteq V_n^c</m>, or equivalently, <m>y\in V_n^c</m>, as desired.

                    Given <m>x\in X</m> let <m>\{U_n\colon n\in \Z_+\}</m> be a countable local basis at <m>x</m>. For each <m>n\geq 1</m>, define <m>V_n=U_1\cap U_2\cap\cdots \cap U_n</m>. (Note that <m>V_n\ne\emptyset</m> since <m>x\in V_n</m>.) We have <m>V_n\supseteq V_{n+1}</m> for all <m>n\geq 1</m>. Furthermore, given any open <m>U\ni x</m>, we have 
                    <m>V_n\subseteq U_n\subseteq U</m>. Thus <m>\{V_n\}</m> forms a nested local basis.

                First, it is easy to see that in any space we have <m>A\subseteq \operatorname{sc} A\subseteq \overline{A}</m>. Thus in any topological space, if <m>A</m> is closed, then we have <m>A=\operatorname{sc} A=\overline{A}</m>, and thus <m>A</m> is sequentially closed. Now assume <m>A</m> is sequentially closed, and take <m>x\in \overline{A}</m>.  Using (1), we pick a a local basis <m>\{V_n\colon n\in \Z_+\}</m> at <m>x</m> that is nested: <ie/>, for all <m>n\geq 1</m>, <m>V_n\supseteq V_{n+1}</m>. Now, for each <m>n\in \Z_+</m> pick an element <m>x_n\in V_n\cap A</m>. We have <m>x_n\rightarrow x</m>: indeed, if <m>U\ni x</m> is any open set containing <m>x</m>, then <m>V_N\subseteq U</m> for some <m>n</m>, in which case  <m>x_k\in V_k\subseteq U</m> for all <m>k\geq N</m>. Since <m>A</m> is sequentially compact, we have <m>x\in A</m>. Thus <m>\overline{A}\subseteq A</m>, and we conclude that <m>A=\overline{A}</m>.

                <p>
                    The forward direction is true in any topological space, as we have shown before. Let's prove the reverse direction. Assume <m>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> is sequentially continuous. Fix any <m>x\in X</m> and open set <m>U</m> containing <m>f(x)=y\in Y</m>. Assume by way of contradiction that there is no open set <m>V\ni x</m> such that <m>f(V)\subseteq U</m>. Let <m>\{V_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m> be a nested local basis at <m>x</m>. Since <m>f(V_n)\not\subseteq U</m> for all <m>n</m>, we can find an <m>x_n\in V_n</m> such that <m>f(x_n)\notin U</m>. The sequence <m>(x_n)</m> converges to <m>x</m>: indeed, given any open <m>V</m> containing <m>x</m> there is an <m>N</m> such that <m>V_N\subseteq V</m>. Since the local basis is nested, we have <m>V_k\subseteq V_N\subseteq V</m> for all <m>k\geq N</m>, and hence <m>x_k\in V</m> for all <m>k\geq N</m>. However, it is clear that <m>(f(x_n))</m> does not converge to <m>f(x)=y</m>, since by construction no <m>f(x_n)</m> lies in the open set <m>U</m>. This contradicts the fact that <m>f</m> is sequentially compact. We conclude that <m>f</m> is continuous.

        <p>
            First observe that the set <m>\Q^n</m> of all <m>n</m>-tuples is countable. According to (2) of <xref ref="th_second_countable"/> it would suffice to show that <m>\Q^n</m> is dense in <m>\R^n</m>.

            being a countable union of countable sets, is countable. I claim it is a basis. It suffices to show that given any <m>\boldy=(y_1,y_2,\dots, y_n)\in \R^n</m> and <m>\epsilon &gt; 0</m>, we can find a <m>B_{1/m}(\boldx)\in \mathcal{B}</m> such that <m>y\in B_{1/m}(\boldx)\subseteq B_\epsilon(\boldy)</m>. To this end pick <m>m\in \Z_+</m> such that <m>1/m&lt; \epsilon/2</m> and pick <m>\boldx\in \Q^n</m>  such that <m>\abs{x_i-y_i}&lt; 1/mn</m>, so that <m>d(\boldx, \boldy)&lt; 1/m&lt; \epsilon/2</m>.

</statement>
<solution>
    <p>
        For each <m>x\in \R</m>, the set <m>\mathcal{B}_x=\{[x,q)\colon q\in \Q\}</m> forms a countable local basis at <m>x</m>. Thus <m>X</m> is first countable. 
    </p>
    <p>
        It is easy to see further that <m>\Q\subseteq \R_\ell</m> is dense with respect to the left limit topology. 
    </p>
    <p>
        To see that <m>X</m> is not second countable, consider any basis <m>\mathcal{B}</m> of <m>X</m>. For each <m>x\in \R</m>, we can find a basis element <m>B_x\in \mathcal{B}</m> such that <m>x\in B_x\subseteq [x,x+1)</m>. Note that since <m>\inf B_x=x</m> for such a <m>B_x</m>, the map <m>x\mapsto B_x</m> defines an injection of <m>\R</m> into <m>\mathcal{B}</m>: <m>B_x=B_y\implies \inf B_x=\inf B_y\implies x=y</m>. This proves that <m>\mathcal{B}</m> is uncountable. 
    </p>
    <p>
        At this point, by (2) of <xref ref="th_second_countable"/> we know that <m>\R_\ell</m> is not metrizable, since it is separable but not second countable. See Munkres for a proof that <m>\R_\ell</m> is also Lindelöf.

                As a result, a countable product of first countable (resp. second countable) spaces is first countable.

                        This is an easy consequence of the fact that for any basis (or local basis) <m>\mathcal{B}</m> of <m>X</m> the corresponding set <m>\mathcal{B}_Y=\{B\cap Y\colon B\in \mathcal{B}\}</m> is a basis (or local basis) in <m>Y</m>.

                    <p>
                        It is easy to see that such a function <m>f</m> maps bases (or local bases) in <m>X</m> to bases (or local bases) in <m>Y</m>.
