      Let <m>(X,\mathcal{T})</m> be a topological space. A subset <m>A\subseteq X</m> is <term>closed</term> if its complement <m>A^c=X-A</m> is open. Equivalently, a subset <m>A</m> is closed if and only if <m>A=U^c</m> for some open set <m>U\in \mathcal{T}</m>.

  <title>Property of closed sets</title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>X</m> be a topological space.
    </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <title>Trivial sets</title>
      <p>
       Both <m>\emptyset</m> and <m>X</m> are closed sets.

    <li>
      <title>Finite unions</title>
      <p>
        If <m>C_1, C_2,\dots , C_n</m> are closed, then <m>\bigcup_{i=1}^n C_i</m> is closed.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <title>Arbitrary intersection</title>
      <p>
        If <m>\{C_i\}_{i\in I}</m> is a collection of closed sets, then <m>\bigcap_{i\in I}C_i</m> is closed.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
    </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Statement (1) follows from the observation that <m>\emptyset^c=X</m>, and <m>X^c=\emptyset</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assume <m>C_i</m> is closed for <m>1\leq i\leq n</m>; then by DeMorgan's law
      <me>
        \left(\bigcup_{i=1}^nC_i\right)^c=\bigcap_{i=1}^n C_i^c
      </me>,
      which is open since <m>C_i^c</m> is open for all <m>1\leq i\leq n</m> and finite intersections of open sets are open. This proves (2).
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, assume <m>C_i</m> is closed for all <m>i\in I</m>. By DeMorgan's law we have
      <me>
        \left(\bigcap_{i\in I}C_i\right)^c=\bigcup_{i\in I}C_i^c
      </me>,
      which is open since <m>C_i^c</m> is open and arbitrary unions of open sets are open.

<remark xml:id="rm_equiv_open_closed">
<title>Closed sets determine topology</title>
    <p>
      In general, given a set <m>X</m> the set complement operation <m>Y\mapsto Y^c=X-Y</m> is defines a bijection
      <md>
        <mrow> \mathcal{P}(X) \amp \leftrightarrow \mathcal{P}(X) </mrow>
        <mrow> Y \amp \mapsto Y^c </mrow>
      </md>,
      that is self-inverse: <ie />, we have <m>(Y^c)^c=Y</m> for all subsets <m>Y\subseteq X</m>. It follows from the <xref ref="d_closed_set"/> that the closed sets of <m>X</m> are in bijective correspondence with the open sets, and thus that a topology on <m>X</m> is uniquely determined by specifying any collection of sets satisfying (1)-(3) from <xref ref="th_closed_props"/>. In other words, a topology is determined by specifying either its open sets or its closed sets.

  <statement>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          If <m>X</m> has the trivial topology, then the only open sets of <m>X</m> are <m>\emptyset, X</m>. Hence the only closed sets are <m>\emptyset^c=X</m> and <m>X^c=\emptyset</m>.

          If <m>X</m> has the discrete topology, then every subset of <m>X</m> is open. It follows that any subset of <m>X</m> is closed, since its complement is open. We conclude that al subsets of <m>X</m> are both open and closed in the discrete topology.

    By definition a set <m>C</m> is closed if and only if its complement <m>X-C</m> is open. Using <xref ref="eq_top_generated2"/>, we see that <m>X-C</m> is open if and only if for all <m>x</m> there is a basis element <m>B\in \mathcal{B} </m> satisfying <m>x\in B\subseteq X-C</m>.

  <solution>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          The set <m>A</m> is not open: any open ball containing the point <m>(0,1)</m> contains points with negative <m>x</m>-coordinate. Hence there is no open ball containing <m>(0,1)</m> that is contained in <m>A</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The set <m>A</m> is closed. If <m>P=(x,y)\in A^c</m>, then either <m>x&lt; 0</m> or <m>y&lt; 0</m>. Let <m>\epsilon=\min\{\abs{x},\abs{y}\}</m>. Every element of <m>B_\epsilon(P)</m> has either a negative <m>x</m>-coordinate or a negative <m>y</m>-coordinate. Hence <m> P\in B_{\epsilon}(P)\subseteq A^c</m>. This proves <m>A</m> is closed, using <xref ref="lemma_basis_closed"/>.

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Again, the set <m>A</m> is not open, as witnessed by <m>(0,1)\in A</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The set <m>A^c</m> is also not open. Take <m>P=(1,0)\in A^c</m>. Any open ball containing <m>P</m> contains points with positive <m>y</m>-coordinate. Thus there is no open ball containing <m>P</m> and contained in <m>A^c</m>. We conclude that <m>A</m> is not closed, using <xref ref="lemma_basis_closed"/>.

  </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Statements (1)-(2): properties of open (resp. closed) sets imply that <m>A^\circ</m> is open and <m>\overline{A}</m> is closed. Furthermore, by definition of <m>A^\circ</m> (resp. <m>\overline{A}</m>) along with simple properties of union/intersection it follows that if <m>U</m> is open and <m>U\subseteq A</m>, then <m>U\subseteq A^\circ</m>; and if <m>C</m> is closed containing <m>A</m>, then <m>\overline{A}\subseteq C</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first equivalence in (3) follows from the definition of <m>A^\circ</m> as a union. The second equivalence follows from the fact that any <m>U</m> is covered by basis elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      We prove (4) as a chain of equivalences. Call the three statements (i), (ii), (iii).
    </p>
    <p>
      Assume <m>x\in \overline{A}</m>.  If <m>U</m> is an open set satisfying <m>U\cap A=\emptyset</m>, then <m>C=U^c</m> is a closed set containing <m>A</m>, and hence contains <m>x</m>. It follows that any open set containing <m>x</m> intersects <m>A</m> nontrivially. This proves (i) <m>\implies</m> (ii).
    </p>
    <p>
      Clearly (ii) implies (iii), since any basis element is an open set.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assume (iii). If <m>C</m> is a closed set containing <m>A</m>, then <m>U=C^c</m> is an open set satisfying <m>U\cap A=\emptyset</m>. It follows from (iii) that <m>x\notin U</m>, and hence that <m>x\in C</m> for all closed sets <m>C</m> containing <m>A</m>. It follows that <m>x\in \overline{A}</m>, the intersection of these sets.

<example xml:id="eg_closure_interior_K">
  <title>Interior and closure of <m>K</m></title>
  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>X=\R</m> and let <m>K=\{1, 1/2, 1/3,\dots,\}=\{1/N\colon N\in\Z_+\}</m>. Compute the interior and closure of <m>K</m> with respect to (a) the standard topology on <m>\R</m> and (b) the <m>K</m>-topology on <m>\R</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <solution>
    <ol marker="(a)">
      <li>
        <p>
          First consider <m>\R</m> with the standard topology. The interior of <m>K</m> is empty in this case: <ie />, <m>K^\circ=\emptyset</m>. To see this, note that given any <m>x=1/N\in K</m> and any open interval <m>(a,b)</m> containing <m>x</m>, we can choose an <m>\epsilon\leq 1/N-1/(N+1)</m> such that <m>(x-\epsilon, x+\epsilon)\subseteq (a,b)</m>; by design <em>all</em> elements of <m>(x-\epsilon, x+\epsilon)-\{x\}</m> lie outside <m>K</m>. Thus <m>x\notin K^\circ</m>, and <m>K^\circ=\emptyset</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next. I claim <m>\overline{K}=K\cup \{0\}</m>. To see this, note first that <m>K\cup \{0\}</m> is closed: it is easy to see that for any <m>x\notin K\cup\{0\}</m> we can find an <m>\epsilon</m> such that <m>(x-\epsilon, x+\epsilon)\cap (K\cup \{0\})=\emptyset</m>. By (2) of <xref ref="th_equivalent_interior_closure"/> we have <m>\overline{K}\subseteq K\cup \{0\}</m>.
          Since furthermore <m>K\subseteq \overline{K}\subseteq K\cup \{0\}</m> and since <m>K</m> itself is not closed, it follows that <m>\overline{K}=K\cup \{0\}</m>.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Now consider the <m>K</m>-topology on <m>\R</m>. We still have <m>K^\circ=\emptyset</m>. Indeed, fix any  <m>x=1/N\in K</m>, and take any basis element <m>B</m> containing <m>x</m>. We have <m>B=(a,b)</m> or <m>B=(a,b)-K</m> for some open interval <m>(a,b)</m>. In either case, the same argument as above shows that <m>B</m> contains a basis element <m>B'=(x-\epsilon, x+\epsilon)-\{x\}</m>, all of whose elements lie outside of <m>K</m>. This shows <m>x\notin K^\circ</m>, and hence <m>K^\circ=\emptyset</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Next, I claim that <m>K</m> is closed in the <m>K</m>-topology, from whence it follows that <m>K=\overline{K}</m>. (Use (2) from <xref ref="th_equivalent_interior_closure"/>.) To prove the claim, we must show, using <xref ref="lemma_basis_closed"/> that for any <m>x\notin K</m> there is a basis element (in the <m>K</m>-topology) containing <m>x</m> and contained in <m>K^c</m>. There are two cases: <m>x\ne 0</m> and <m>x=0</m>. If <m>x\ne 0</m>, we can find an open interval <m>(a,b)</m> such that <m>x\in (a,b)</m> and <m>(a,b)\cap K=\emptyset</m>. Since open intervals are basis elements in the <m>K</m>-topology, we are done in this case. Next, assume
          <m>x=0</m>. In this case the basis element <m>B=(-1,1)-K</m> satisfies <m>x\in B\subseteq K^c</m>. Having exhausted the cases, we conclude <m>K</m> is closed, and hence <m>\overline{K}=K</m>.
