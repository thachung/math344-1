      The following statements are equivalent for a topological space <m>X</m>.

    <p>
  <m>(1)\iff (2) \iff (3)</m>. It is clear that a separation <m>X=U\cup V</m> by open sets is the same thing as a separation as described in (2), since <m>U=V^c</m> and <m>V=U^c</m> are both open and closed. Similarly, we see that there is a separation <m>X=U\cup V</m> if and only if and only if there is a nonempty open set <m>U</m> whose complement <m>U^c</m> is open and nonempty, if and only if there is a nontrival <m>U</m> that is open and closed. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <m>(2)\iff (4)</m>. This equivalence follows from the observation that we have <m>X=A\cup B</m> with <m>A, B</m> as described in (4) if and only if <m>A=\overline{A}</m> and <m>B=\overline{B}</m>, if and only if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are disjoint and closed.

  <p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Given a separation <m>X=U_1\cup U_2</m>, we have <m>Y=U_1'\cup U_2'</m>, where  <m>U_i'=U_i\cap Y</m>. Since <m>U_1', U_2'</m> are disjoint open subsets of the subspace <m>Y</m>, we have <m>Y\subseteq U_1'</m> or <m>Y\subseteq U_2'</m>. It follows that <m>Y\subseteq U_1</m> or <m>Y\subseteq U_2</m>.

Now since <m>Y_i</m> is connected for all <m>i</m> we must have <m>Y_i\subseteq U_1</m> or <m>Y\subseteq U_2</m> by (1). Since <m>y\in Y_i</m> and <m>y\in U_1</m>, it follows that <m>Y_i\subseteq U_1</m> for all <m>i\in I</m>. Thus <m>Y=\bigcup_{i\in I}Y_i\subseteq U_1</m>. We conclude that <m>U_1=Y</m>.

By (1) we have <m>Y\subseteq C</m> or <m>Y\subseteq D</m>. Assume without loss of generality that <m>Y\subseteq C</m>. Since <m>C</m> is closed, the closure of <m>Y</m> in <m>Y'</m> is contained in <m>C</m>. But as we have seen in an earlier homework, the closure of <m>Y</m> in <m>Y'</m> is <m>Y'\cap \overline{Y}=Y'</m>. Thus <m>Y'\subseteq C</m>, or equivalently, <m>C=Y'</m>.

<theorem xml:id="th_connected_continuous">
  <title>Connectedness and continuity</title>

      If <m>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> is continuous and <m>X</m> is connected, then <m>f(X)</m> is connected.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
    We identify <m>f</m> with the map <m>f\colon X\rightarrow f(X)</m> obtained by restricting the codomain, which is continuous <em>and</em> surjective. If <m>U_1, U_2</m> are disjoint open sets satisfying <m>f(X)=U_1\cup U_2</m>, then we have <m>X=f^{-1}(f(X))=f^{-1}(U_1)\cup f^{-1}(U_2)</m>. Since the sets <m>f^{-1}(U_i)</m> are open and disjoint, we have <m>X=f^{-1}(U_1)</m> or <m>X=f^{-1}(U_2)</m>. Since <m>f</m> is surjective, we have <m>f(f^{-1}(U_i))=U_i</m> for <m>1\leq i\leq 2</m>. It follows that <m>U_1=f(X)</m> or <m>U_2=f(X)</m>. We conclude <m>f(X)</m> is connected.

  </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Define <m>F\colon X\rightarrow \rightarrow X\times Y</m> as <m>F(x)=(\id_X(x),f(x))=(x,f(x))</m>. Since the two component functions <m>\id_X\colon X\rightarrow X</m> and <m>f\colon X\rightarrow Y</m> are continuous, so is <m>F</m>. From <xref ref="th_connected_continuous"/>, we conclude that <m>F(X)=\Gamma_f</m> is continuous.

<theorem xml:id="th_connected_products">
  <statement>
    <p>
      A product space <m>X=\prod_{i\in I}X_i</m> (with product topology) is connected if and only if <m>X_i</m> is connected for all <m>i\in I</m>.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <proof>
    <p>
      Although the statement is indeed true for arbitrary products, we prove it only for finite and countably infinite products. 
    </p>
    <case>
      <title>Finite products</title>
    <p>
      Using induction it suffices to show that if <m>X, Y</m> are connected, then <m>X\times Y</m> is connected. First, choose any <m>x_0\in X</m> and note that the subspace <m>\{x_0\}\times Y</m>, being homeomorphic to <m>Y</m>, is connected. Similarly, for any <m>y_0\in Y</m>, the subspace <m>X\times \{y_0\}</m> is connected. It follows from (2) of <xref ref="th_connected_subspace"/> that the set <m>T_{x_0,y_0}=\{x_0\}\times Y\cup X\times \{y_0\}</m> is connected for any <m>(x_0,y_0)\in X\times Y</m>. Lastly, since <m>T_{x,y_0}\cap T_{x',y_0}\supseteq X\times\{y_0\}\ne \emptyset</m> for any <m>x,x'\in X</m>, the union <m>\bigcup_{x\in X}T_{x,y_0}</m> is connected. But this union is <m>X</m> itself.  
    </p>
    </case>
    <case>
      <title>Countable product</title>
      <p>
        Let <m>X=\prod_{n=1}^\infty X_n</m> where <m>X_n</m> is connected for all <m>n</m>. Fix any element <m>x=(x_1,x_2,\dots, )\in X</m>. For each <m>N</m> the set 
      <me>
        X_N=\prod_{n=1}^NX_i\times \prod_{n=N+1}^\infty \{x_n\}
      </me>,
      being homeomorphic to a finite product of connected spaces, is connected. Since <m>X_N\cap X_{M}\ne \emptyset</m> for all <m>N, M</m>, we conclude that <m>Y=\bigcup_{N=1}^\infty X_N</m> is connected.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, I claim that <m>X=\overline{Y}</m>. Indeed, given any <m>z=(z_1,z_2,\dots, )</m> and any open base element <m>U=\prod_{n=1}^NU_n\times \prod_{n=N+1}^\infty X_n</m> containing <m>z</m>, we have <m>(z_1,z_2,\dots, z_N, x_{N+1},x_{N+2},\dots)\in U\cap X_N\subseteq Y</m>. Since connectedness is preserved under closure, we conclude that <m>X</m> is connected.
